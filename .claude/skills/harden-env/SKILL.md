This is the critical human-review step where most agent shortcuts are caught and fixed. Use after evolve-env when each task can be walked through but the environment may still be trivially easy."

# Harden Environment — Difficulty & Fidelity Hardening

## When to use

- After Phase 3 (evolve-env) when each task in `tasks.jsonl` is walkable
- When a reviewer reports tasks are too easy or have answer leaks
- When an agent solves tasks by clicking the first/only result

## Why this phase exists

Coding agents consistently produce environments where tasks are technically
solvable but trivially easy. The agent's implicit goal is "make the task
work," not "make it challenging." This leads to:

- Answers visible in search results without clicking detail pages
- Databases with only the target item (no distractors)
- Search results pre-sorted to put the answer at position #1

**Human review is essential.** Automated checks (`_health.py`, byte-identical
reset) verify correctness, not difficulty.

## The 4 hardening dimensions

### Dimension A: De-leak answers

For each task in `sites/<site>/tasks.jsonl`, check whether the answer is
visible without navigating to a detail page.

| Where to check | What to look for | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Search result titles | Task constraint values in `product.name` | Strip from name, push to specs/description |
| Card subtitles | Pre-computed answers ("48 GB more storage") | Show raw values, force agent to compute |
| Section headings | Count labels next to a list | Remove count; let agent count items |
| Page titles | Task question echoed | Use descriptive titles, not questions |
| Search snippets | Answer text in preview | Truncate snippets |

**The 13 known leak archetypes** (from building 15 mirrors):

1. Numeric difference/comparison pre-computed
2. Count of items the agent should count
3. Verbatim task framing word echoed
4. Pre-bundled answer sentence
5. Pinned/highlighted answer callout
6. Spoon-fed list endings with count
7. Wiki one-paragraph matching task question
8. Operand-only fuzzy-match in search backends
9. Bare-anchor → answer-bucket flood (maps/places)
10. Algorithm-revealing UI text ("sorted by distance")
11. Sort order putting answer at position #1
12. Pre-curated lookup table with fuzzy matching
13. Constraint values in product/item names

### Dimension B: Near-miss distractors

For each task's natural search query, results should contain:

- 1-3 full-match items (the correct answers)
- ≥5 near-miss items (match category, fail ONE constraint)
- ≤50% full-match density overall

How to create near-misses: take a full-match and flip one constraint:
- Price above/below the target range
- Different spec (screen size, weight, color)
- Different brand/category close to target
- Remove one required feature

### Dimension C: Catalog breadth

Search queries must return ≥6 results from multiple sub-categories.

Signs of insufficient breadth:
- A zip code search returns only restaurants (add gyms, banks, pharmacies)
- A "laptop" search returns 3 results (add 15+ laptops across brands)
- A category page has only the target items

### Dimension D: Cross-field consistency

After modifying ANY field on an item, regenerate ALL related fields:

```
specs → source of truth
  ↓ regenerate ↓
description (prose matching specs)
features (bullet points from specs)
feature_tags (short labels from specs)
variant_options (if applicable)
name (should NOT contain constraint values)
```

**The bug that keeps hitting us**: change `specs["OS"]` from "Windows 11
Home" to "Windows 11 Pro" but leave `features` saying "Windows 11 Home
pre-installed." The detail page shows both, confusing agents.

## Verification process

Drive every check through Playwright, not curl. The point of hardening is to catch what a real browser-driving agent will see — only Playwright reproduces that surface. Reading templates by eye, or `curl | grep`, will silently miss client-side JS injections, hidden form fields, and async-rendered cards. Use the `agent_demo/` env (`uv sync` there already pulls Playwright + Chromium):

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto(f"http://localhost:41000/?q={query}")     # alt-port test container
    page.wait_for_load_state("networkidle")
    page.screenshot(path=f"/tmp/{task_id}_search.png", full_page=True)
    rendered = page.content()                            # grep THIS for leaks
    # ...repeat for each task; only open detail pages via page.click(...), not by hand
```

For EACH task:

1. Open the mirror at `http://localhost:41000+i/` in Playwright
2. Read the task instruction from `tasks.jsonl`
3. Run the natural search query via `page.fill` + `page.click`; screenshot the results page; grep `page.content()` for the answer string
4. Count full-match vs near-miss results from the rendered DOM
5. Check ≥6 diverse results in the screenshot
6. Click into the correct answer's detail page via Playwright; verify all fields agree across specs / description / features
7. Record pass/fail per dimension, attach screenshot path

## After hardening: re-verify the invariants

Hardening changes seed data. After any DB change:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh webharbor:dev
docker run -d --rm --name wh-test \
  -p 8201:8101 -p 41000-41025:40000-40025 webharbor:dev
curl -X POST http://localhost:8201/reset/<your_site>
docker exec wh-test md5sum \
  /opt/WebSyn/<your_site>/instance/<your_site>.db \
  /opt/WebSyn/<your_site>/instance_seed/<your_site>.db
# md5s must match
```

If your hardening changes touched `static/images/` or seed DB, you'll also
need to bump `.assets-revision` after uploading to HuggingFace (see
`CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## Output

After Phase 4:
- Zero answer leaks across all tasks
- Each task has ≥5 near-miss distractors
- Search returns diverse results from multiple sub-categories
- Cross-field consistency verified
- Byte-identical reset still passes

## Next step

Proceed to **seed-database** (Phase 5) for final seed-DB stabilization and
the asset-split workflow.
