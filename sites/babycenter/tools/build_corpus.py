"""Turn the fetched source articles into the mirror's content corpus.

Design rules, in order of importance:

1. Every factual sentence the site serves is a **verbatim excerpt** from an
   openly licensed upstream article, carried with its source, section and the
   exact revision it came from.
2. Excerpts are located by explicit anchors. If an anchor stops matching --
   because the upstream article was edited -- the build **fails loudly** rather
   than silently dropping or inventing content.
3. No template text stands in for a fact. Presentation wording is clearly
   presentation; facts are quoted.

Input : sites/babycenter/source_data/wikipedia/*.json  (from fetch_sources.py)
Output: sites/babycenter/source_data/corpus.json       (tracked, deterministic)

# is an exact substring of the upstream plain-text extract; the whole sentence
