"""Idempotent benchmark community seeding for the Discogs mirror.

The catalog comes from the verified instance_seed/discogs.db asset.
refresh_catalog.py imports complete, captured Discogs release responses;
unknown catalog facts are never generated at boot. Users, ratings, reviews,
collections and marketplace listings are synthetic benchmark state.

Every seed function returns before writing when its data is already present,
