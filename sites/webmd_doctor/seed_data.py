"""Deterministic seed for the WebMD Doctor mirror.

Run directly (`PYTHONHASHSEED=0 python seed_data.py`) to rebuild
`instance_seed/webmd_doctor.db` (this is what the Docker build does).
`PYTHONHASHSEED=0 python seed_data.py --write-images` additionally regenerates
`static/images/avatars/*.png` and `static/images/posters/*.png`; those PNGs
ship through the pinned Hugging Face asset tarball, never from the image
build. Byte-reproducible within the pinned toolchain (Python 3.12,
Pillow==11.0.0, and the SQLite build in python:3.12-slim): one seeded RNG, no
wall-clock reads, deterministic iteration, hard-coded password hashes, PNGs
without ancillary chunks. SQLite file bytes can differ across SQLite library
versions even when every logical row is identical; the runtime reset contract
(instance/ == instance_seed/ byte-for-byte) holds in every environment because
reset copies the frozen file.

Every doctor, practice, hospital, address, phone, NPI, school and review is
synthetic. Real city / state / specialty / insurer names are reused only as
vocabulary.
